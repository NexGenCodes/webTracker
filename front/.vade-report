# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights into the Next.js project (App Router) as requested. The implementation follows the official Vercel documentation for Next.js App Router applications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- **File Modified:** `package.json`
- **Change:** Added `@vercel/speed-insights` package (version ^1.3.1) to dependencies
- **File Modified:** `package-lock.json`
- **Change:** Updated lockfile with new package and its dependencies (503 packages added)

### 2. Component Integration
- **File Modified:** `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";`
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component at the bottom of the body tag, just before the closing `</body>` tag
  - This placement ensures Speed Insights will track performance metrics across all pages

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the recommended pattern for Next.js App Router (16.1.2+):
- Uses the `@vercel/speed-insights/next` package for seamless Next.js integration
- Component is placed in the root layout to ensure tracking across the entire application
- The SpeedInsights component is a wrapper around the tracking script that automatically handles route tracking

## Testing Results

✅ **Linting:** No new linting errors introduced (all existing errors are pre-existing)
✅ **Tests:** All tests pass (2 tests in vitals.test.ts)
✅ **Build:** TypeScript compilation error exists but is pre-existing (unrelated to Speed Insights)

Note: There is a pre-existing TypeScript error in `src/components/I18nContext.tsx` related to dictionary type mismatches. This error existed before the Speed Insights implementation and is not caused by these changes.

## Next Steps

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard under Project > Speed Insights tab
2. The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` route will be available after deployment
3. Performance metrics will start being collected automatically
4. View data in the Vercel dashboard under the Speed Insights tab after users visit the site

## Files Modified
